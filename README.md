This is a complete Android app that interacts with a backend server. While you can't fully run the app locally without the server (since it relies on server APIs), you can still use it for testing and experimentation.

### Setup Instructions:

- Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/memeusix/Ekspensify.git
    ```

- Open the project in **Android Studio**.
- **Build and run** the app.

**Note**: You can explore and experiment with the app locally, though server-dependent features like network calls and Google auth will require the backend.
